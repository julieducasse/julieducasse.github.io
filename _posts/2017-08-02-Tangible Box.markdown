The Tangible Box is a compact and low-cost tangible interface for visually impaired students. 
It enhances tactile graphics with tangible interaction, making them not only interactive, but also manipulable.  

The Tangible Box can be used for a large variety of topics, such as maths, biology, geography, history, etc.
It supports different types of learning-by-doing activities: (re)construction, exploration, annotation, edition. 
It can also be used with several types of tactile graphics, such as 3D-printed graphics, laser-cut wooden or plastic graphics, graphics printed on special paper (raised-line and thermoformed graphics), German film, and regular paper.

To ensure the stability of the objects and avoid occlusions, the objects are composed of two magnets : one is placed above the surface, the other below the surface.
A tag is attached to this magnet to track its position. When the user moves the upper magnet, the magnet placed below moves accordingly. 

A wide-angle camera is placed inside the box, along with a Raspberry and a LED string light, making the Tangible Box compact, low-cost and easy to install.

Up to now, we developed two applications and conducted participatory design sessions with 5 specialized teachers. We plan to conduct user studies during the next school year.
