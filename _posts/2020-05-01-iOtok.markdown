excerpt: We studied the impact and usability of web documentaries, using iOtok as a case study.
---

iOtok is a web documentary composed of 13 episodes that were released on a weekly basis in 2017, in Slovenia and Croatia. It tells the story of the last inhabitants of Biševo, a small croatian island threatened by mass tourism. We use it as a case study to understand how people interact with web-documentaries.

# In short

![iOtok](/assets/posts/iOtok.png)

We looked at several aspects of the reception of iOtok.
1. **Audience reception**: which channels were the most effective? Social media, newsletter, news portal, etc. What do motivate people to return to the website regularly?
2. Is **interactivity** a good thing? In order to acccess the core videos of each episode, users had to click on several elements. We analyse when/whether users quit the web-portal before reaching the video. We also look at how effective the other interactive features were (chat, news portal, audio narrations, etc.)
3. How do users consume **videos**? Do they skip content? Do they binge-watch? In what order to they watch the episodes?
4. What was/is the **social impact** of iOtok? Did it affect the lives of the inhabitants of Biševo? Did it raise awareness?
