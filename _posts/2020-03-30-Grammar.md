Learning Slovenian is definitely not a piece of cake, especially if your native language is not a Slavic language. 

Declensions are definitively the number 1 reason why learning Slovene is difficult. Whenever you use a noun in your sentence, you have to consider the *gender* (which English does not), the *number* (which English only does for the 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular in the present tense) and... the "role" of your noun in the sentence, also referred as *case* (or <span class="slo">skloni</span>).  

The first two parameters are enough to make Slovenian relatively complex because there are three different *genders* (female, male and neutral) as well as three different *numbers* (singular, plural and... dual). But the third parameter is definitely a big thing: there are six different *cases*! Altogether, these variations sum up to 3 * 3 * 6 = 56 possible forms for each noun. In practise, several of these forms are very similar and can be learnt together.

So let's start with easier parts of the Slovenian grammar: the verbs and three basic tenses, the past, the present and the future. 

# Present

For the present tense, the ending of the verb only depends on the *number* of the subject of the verb. You need to add the following endings to the stem of the verb. Here is an example for the verb <span class="slo">imeti</span>, meaning <span class="en">to have</span>. Note that there is no ending at the 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular.

| | Singular | Dual | Plural |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1<sup>st</sup> person | **-m**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***m**</span> (I have)| **-va**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***va**</span> (we both have)   | **-mo**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***mo**</span> (we have)   |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person | **-š**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***š**</span> (You have) | **-ta**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***ta**</span> (you both have)  | **-te**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***te**</span> (You have)  |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person | **-**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a*</span> (S/he has) | **-ta**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***ta**</span> (they both have) | **-jo**<br/><span class="slo-n">Im*a***jo**</span> (They have) |  

<br>

The vowel before the endings (in italics in the example) depends on the infinitive form of the verb: 

* some verbs with an infinitive ending in "*-iti*" have a "*i*" before the ending. For example the verb <span class="slo">govor**iti**</span>, <span class="en">to speak</span>: <span class="slo">govor***i***m, govor***i***š, govor***i***</span>, etc... 
* some verbs with an infinitive ending in "*-ati*" have a "*a*" before the ending. For example the verb <span class="slo">gled**ati**</span>, <span class="en">to watch</span>: <span class="slo">gled***a***m, gled***a***š, gled***a***</span>, etc...

Unfortunately, plenty of verbs with an infinitive ending in "*-iti*" do not have "*i*" as a main vowel, and plenty of verbs with an infinitive  ending in "*-ati*" do not have "*a*" as a main vowel. It means that you need to know at least one form of the verb at the present tense. For example, the verb <span class="en">to write</span>, which is <span class="slo">pisati</span>, goes like this: <span class="slo">piš*e***m**, piš*e***š**, piš*e*, piš*e***va**, piš*e***ta**</span>, etc.  and not like "pisam, pisaš", etc. 

Some verbs also have different forms depending on the person: in that case, you need to know (almost) all them. For example, the verb <span class="en">to eat</span> translates to <span class="slo">jesti</span> and the 1<sup>st</sup> person singular is <span class="slo">j*e***m**</span> (<span class="en">I eat</span>). Almost all the forms follow the rules: <span class="slo">j*e***m**</span> (<span class="en">I eat</span>), <span class="slo">j*e***š**</span> (<span class="en">you eat</span>), <span class="slo">j*e*</span> (<span class="en">s/he eats</span>), <span class="slo">j*e***mo**</span> (<span class="en">we eat</span>), <span class="slo">j*e***jo**</span> (<span class="en">they eat</span>) but it is <span class="slo">j*e*s**ta**</span> (<span class="en">you both eat / they both eat</span>) and <span class="slo">j*e*s**te**</span> (<span class="en">you eat</span>), with an additionnal **s** in between the vowel and the ending.

In conclusion, when you learn a new verb, *you must learn (at least) one of its form at the present tense*.

# Past & Future

The past and future tenses are very similar so I'll present them together: 

* To conjugate a verb in the **past**, you must use the present form of the verb <span class="en">to be</span> + the participle of the verb. The verb <span class="en">to be</span> at the present tense is: <span class="slo">sem</span> (<span class="en">I am</span>), <span class="slo">si</span> (<span class="en">you are</span>), <span class="slo">je</span> (<span class="en">s/he is</span>), <span class="slo">sva</span> (<span class="en">we both are</span>), <span class="slo">sta</span> (<span class="en">you both are</span>), <span class="slo">sta</span> (<span class="en">they both are</span>), <span class="slo">smo</span> (<span class="en">we are</span>), <span class="slo">ste</span> (<span class="en">you are</span>), <span class="slo">so</span> (<span class="en">they are</span>). 

For example, if I am a woman, <span class="en">I knew</span> translates to <span class="slo">Jaz sem vedela</span> and <span class="en">they knew</span> translates to <span class="slo">oni so vedeli</span>. 

* To conjugate a verb in the **future**, you must use the future form of the verb <span class="en">to be</span> + the participle of the verb. The verb <span class="en">to be</span> at the future tense is: <span class="slo">bom</span> (<span class="en">I will be</span>), <span class="slo">boš</span> (<span class="en">you will be</span>), <span class="slo">bo</span> (<span class="en">s/he will be</span>), <span class="slo">bova</span> (<span class="en">we will both be</span>), <span class="slo">bosta</span> (<span class="en">you will both be</span>), <span class="slo">bosta</span> (<span class="en">they will both be</span>), <span class="slo">bomo</span> (<span class="en">we will be</span>), <span class="slo">boste</span> (<span class="en">you will be</span>), <span class="slo">bodo</span> (<span class="en">they will be</span>).

For example, <span class="en">I will see</span> translates to <span class="slo">Jaz bom videla</span> (if I am a woman) and to <span class="slo">Jaz bom videl</span> (if I am a man). <span class="en">They will see</span> translates to <span class="slo">Oni bodo videli</span>.

For the verb <span class="en">to be</span> (<span class="slo">biti</span>), we do not use the participle (<span class="slo">bil(a/i/o/e)</span>) *and* the future form: therefore we do not say "Jaz bom bila" but <span class="slo">Jaz bom</span> (although some people do use both forms).

### Participle
How do you know the participle of the verb? For regular verbs, if you know one present form of the verb, you just need to replace the ending by <span class="slo">*-l*, *-la*, *-lo*, *-li* or *-le*</span> (I explain the differences between these forms just after). For example, the verb <span class="en">to watch</span> is <span class="slo">gledati</span>. In the present tense, we saw it was <span class="slo">gledam, gledaš, gleda, ...</span>. Therefore the participle of <span class="slo">gledati</span> is <span class="slo">gledal(a/o/i/e)</span>.

But there is also plenty of verbs where the participle cannot be infered from the present form. For example the verb <span class="en">to stay</span>, which is <span class="slo">stati</span>, has an irregular present form (<span class="slo">stojim, stojiš, ...</span>) but a regular participle: <span class="slo">stal, stala, ...</span>

In conclusion, when you learn a new verb, *you must learn its present form AND its participle*.

**What are these <span class="slo">*-l*, *-la*, *-lo*, *-li* or *-le*</span>?**

When you use the past or future tense, you must know the number **and the gender** of the subject of the verb, as shown in the following table.


| Singular | Dual | Plural|
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Male: **-l**     | At least one male noun: **-la**       | At least one male noun: **-li**   |
| Female: **-la**  | 2 female nouns: **-li**                          | Female nouns only: **-le**  |
| Neutral: **-lo** | 2 neutral nouns:  **-li**                          | Neutral nouns only: **-la** |


# Interactive verbs

Here is a tiny widget to play with the verbs. You can select a verb among the list and switch between the tenses (past, present and future) as well as choose one specific number and gender.

I focused on two important verbs (<span class="en">to be</span> and <span class="en">to have</span>), two regular verbs (<span class="en">to work</span> and <span class="en">to speak</span>) and four irregular verbs (<span class="en">to go</span>, <span class="en">to eat</span>, <span class="en">to sleep</span>, <span class="en">to live</span>).

Not all of these verbs go with all kind of nouns, hence the restricted number of sentences for the *neutral* category.
