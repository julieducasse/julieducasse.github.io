# In short
Despite their omnipresence and essential role in our everyday lives, online and printed graphical representations are inaccessible
to visually impaired people because they cannot be explored using the sense of touch. The gap between sighted and visually impaired people’s access 
to graphical representations is constantly growing due to the increasing development and availability of online and dynamic representations 
that not only give sighted people the opportunity to access large amounts of data, but also to interact with them using advanced functionalities 
such as panning, zooming and filtering. In contrast, the techniques currently used to make maps and diagrams accessible to visually impaired people 
require the intervention of tactile graphics specialists and result in non-interactive tactile representations.

However, based on recent advances in the automatic production of content, we can expect in the coming years a growth in the availability of adapted content, 
which must go hand-in-hand with the development of affordable and usable devices. In particular, these devices should make full use of visually impaired users’ 
perceptual capacities and support the display of interactive and updatable representations. A number of research prototypes have already been developed. 
Some rely on digital representation only, and although they have the great advantage of being instantly updatable, they provide very limited tactile feedback, 
which makes their exploration cognitively demanding and imposes heavy restrictions on content. On the other hand, most prototypes that rely on digital 
and physical representations allow for a two-handed exploration that is both natural and efficient at retrieving and encoding spatial information, but 
they are physically limited by the use of a tactile overlay, making them impossible to update. Other alternatives are either extremely expensive 
(e.g. braille tablets) or offer a slow and limited way to update the representation (e.g. maps that are 3D-printed based on users’ inputs).

In this thesis, we propose to bridge the gap between these two approaches by investigating how to develop physical interactive maps and diagrams 
that support two-handed exploration, while at the same time being updatable and affordable. To do so, we build on previous research on 
Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) and particularly on (actuated) tabletop TUIs, two fields of research that have surprisingly received 
little interest concerning visually impaired users. Based on the design, implementation and evaluation of three tabletop TUIs 
(the [Tangible Reels](https://julieducasse.github.io/jekyll/update/2016/07/14/Tangible-Reels.html), 
the [Tangible Box](https://julieducasse.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/08/02/Tangible-Box.html) and 
[BotMap](https://julieducasse.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/08/01/BotMap.html)), we propose innovative non-visual interaction techniques and technical solutions 
that will hopefully serve as a basis for the design of future TUIs for visually impaired users, and encourage their development and use. 
We investigate how tangible maps and diagrams can support various tasks, ranging from the (re)construction of diagrams to the exploration 
of maps by panning and zooming. From a theoretical perspective we contribute to the research on accessible graphical representations by 
highlighting how research on maps can feed research on diagrams and vice-versa. We also propose a [classification](https://julieducasse.github.io/jekyll/update/2016/08/14/Classification-&-Literature-review.html)
 and comparison of existing prototypes to deliver a structured overview of current research.
