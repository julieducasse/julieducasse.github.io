Learning Slovene is not easy at all, and finding ressources to learn Slovene can be even more challenging! So here is a list of ressources that might prove useful.

# Online tools
* [www.slonline.si](https://www.slonline.si/) is the perfect website to learn lots of basic words.
* [PONS](https://en.pons.com/translate/slovenian-english) is the best Slovene-English/French online dictionnary that I've found so far. You can save your favorite words and it also work on their mobile app.
* [Besana](https://besana.amebis.si/pregibanje/) is a great tool get the correct declension of a word, although the number of searchs in limited and you need to wait a couple of seconds between several searches.
* Online course on [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/) with different pricing plans. A bit too slow and repetitive for me but a colleague of mine enjoyed it.

Other tools that I found online but that I haven't tried yet:
* [Basic words and sentences](http://ilanguages.org/slovene.php) with audio files.
* [A spell checker](https://fran.si/134/slovenski-pravopis).
* [Ebralec](https://ebralec.si/branje/), a Text-To-Speech service.
* [Online book](http://www.goethe-verlag.com/book2/EN/ENSL/ENSL002.HTM) to learn online.

# Books  
On this [website](https://archive.org/details/SloveneSlovenianLanguageLearningPack) you can download several books. Among them, [**Colloquial Slovene - A complete language course**](https://ia801608.us.archive.org/28/items/SloveneSlovenianLanguageLearningPack/02%20Colloquial%20Slovene%20A%20Complete%20Language%20Course.pdf) has helped me a lot. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find the corresponding audio files.

I also bought a book from [Assimil](https://www.assimil.com/guides-conversation/333-slovene-de-poche-9782700504903.html), which turned out to be a good investment.

# Newspapers  
Total Slovenia News and Časoris (a newspaper for children) propose every week [a short article for children](https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/tag/dual-text) written in English and Slovenian.

# TV  
The ["otroški portal" (kids' portal)](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija) of the RTVSlo is good place to start: it has lots of short videos, including videos in slovene with slovene subtitles! And this is not so easy to find :). You need to create an account to access the videos. You have the choice between videos for toddlers and more advanced videos. Among videos with subtitles: 
- [Aktivatorji](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250555) was ok-ish in terms of vocabulary.
- [Srečo Kuha Cmok](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250695) is a culinary show for kids with many words related to food, which makes it easier to understand as they are the first words you learn.
- [čebelice](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250951) is a mix of video, podcast and storytelling. It is for kids, but very relaxing.

On the regular portal of [RTVSlo](https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/) you can also watch videos, but not all of them are with subtitles. I watched [MAME](https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/mame), a series with subtitles.

# Radio and podcasts
I'm not sure podcasts are the best resources to learn Slovene, but I did try to listen to some of them:
* [Metina lista](https://metinalista.si/category/podkasti/) lists podcasts they produce. Among them, [Meta PHoDcast](https://metinalista.si/category/phodcast/) are (in my opinion) easier because PhD students tend to rely on words that are similar in English (esp. if they work on computer-related topics).
* [Lahko noč, otroci! (Good night, kids)](https://radioprvi.rtvslo.si/lahko-noc-otroci/) features 5 to 10 minutes long stories for children.
* [RTVSlo](https://www.rtvslo.si/podkasti) has many podcasts, but they are for native speakers and growns-up so difficult to understand.

# YouTube Channels
* [ABC Slovene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVN1fkNwfq_hne0nXdLXmw/videos) 
* [Alja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIbzxu9LTpAuwQCUa81g2ew)
