Learning Slovene is not easy at all, and finding ressources to learn Slovene can be even more challenging! So here is a list of ressources that might prove useful.

# Online tools
* [www.slonline.si](https://www.slonline.si/) is the perfect website to learn lots of basic words.
* [PONS](https://en.pons.com/translate/slovenian-english) is a Slovene-English/French online dictionnary. You can save your favorite words. They also have a good mobile app.
* [Besana](https://besana.amebis.si/pregibanje/) is a great tool to get the correct declension of a word, although the number of searches is limited.
* Online course on [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/) with different pricing plans.

Other tools that I haven't tried yet:
* [Basic words and sentences](http://ilanguages.org/slovene.php) with audio files.
* [A spell checker](https://fran.si/134/slovenski-pravopis).
* [Ebralec](https://ebralec.si/branje/), a Text-To-Speech service.
* [Online book](http://www.goethe-verlag.com/book2/EN/ENSL/ENSL002.HTM) to learn online.

# Books  
On this [website](https://archive.org/details/SloveneSlovenianLanguageLearningPack) you can download several books. Among them, [**Colloquial Slovene - A complete language course**](https://ia801608.us.archive.org/28/items/SloveneSlovenianLanguageLearningPack/02%20Colloquial%20Slovene%20A%20Complete%20Language%20Course.pdf) has helped me a lot. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find the corresponding audio files.

I also bought a book from [Assimil](https://www.assimil.com/guides-conversation/333-slovene-de-poche-9782700504903.html), which turned out to be a good investment.

# Newspapers  
Total Slovenia News and Časoris (a newspaper for children) propose every week [a short article for children](https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/tag/dual-text) written in English and Slovenian.

[Rtvslo](https://www.rtvslo.si/enostavno/) has a portal where news are presented with simple sentences and words (text+audio).

# TV  
The ["otroški portal" (kids' portal)](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija) of the RTVSlo is good place to start: it has lots of short videos, including videos in slovene with slovene subtitles. You need to create an account to access the videos. You have the choice between videos for toddlers and more advanced videos. Among videos with subtitles: 
- [Aktivatorji](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250555) was ok-ish in terms of vocabulary.
- [Srečo Kuha Cmok](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250695) is a culinary show for kids.
- [čebelice](https://otroski.rtvslo.si/televizija/oddaja/173250951) is a mix of video, podcast and storytelling. It's for kids, but very relaxing.

On the regular portal of [RTVSlo](https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/) you can also watch videos, but not all of them are with subtitles. [MAME](https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/mame) and [Nova Dvajseta](https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/nova-dvajseta) are two slovene series with subtitles.  

# Radio and podcasts
* [Metina lista](https://metinalista.si/category/podkasti/) produce several podcats.
* [Lahko noč, otroci! (Good night, kids)](https://radioprvi.rtvslo.si/lahko-noc-otroci/) features 5 to 10 minutes long stories for children.
* [RTVSlo](https://www.rtvslo.si/podkasti) has many podcasts, but they are for native speakers and growns-up so difficult to understand.  

# YouTube Channels
* [ABC Slovene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVN1fkNwfq_hne0nXdLXmw/videos) 
* [Alja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIbzxu9LTpAuwQCUa81g2ew)
