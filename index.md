# In short

I am a French part-time researcher at the [HICUP Lab](https://dist.famnit.upr.si/en/HICUP), in Koper, Slovenia, where I also teach Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualisation. Before coming to Slovenia, I did a [PhD]({% post_url 2017-11-03-Thesis %}) in Computer Science at the University of Toulouse. 

You can see my research projects [here](research) and a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Fdzo-agAAAAJ&hl=en).

When I'm not working, I am reading, travelling, learning Slovenian, designing data visualisations or supporting others in writing and editing documents (grant proposals, documentaries). You can find some projects and articles in my [Notebook](notebook).  

<p style="color: RebeccaPurple">*I'm open to new opportunities so feel free to contact me for anything that involves data analysis or writing at ducajul@gmail.com.*</p>
