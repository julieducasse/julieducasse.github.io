# In short

I am a French researcher and data analyst living in Koper, Slovenia.

I currently work for [Sandbag](https://sandbag.be/), an environmental think tank. I am mainly working on [Sandbag's model](https://sandbag.be/index.php/euets-simulator/) of the EU Emissions Trading System.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [HICUP Lab](https://hicup.famnit.upr.si/) in Slovenia, and I did a [PhD]({% post_url 2017-11-03-Thesis %}) in Computer Science at the University of Toulouse in France. You can see my research projects [here](research) and a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Fdzo-agAAAAJ&hl=en).

When I'm not working, I am reading, hiking, travelling, learning Slovenian, designing data visualisations or supporting others in writing and editing documents. I volunteered for [FotoVertical](https://www.fotovertical.com/en/) - a film production company - as well as for [OÅ¡tro](https://www.ostro.si/si/zgodbe/vecina-mladih-v-dusevni-stiski-pomoci-ne-dobi-pravocasno), an investigative newsroom. You can find some projects and articles in my [Notebook](notebook).  

<p style="color: RebeccaPurple">*I'm always open to new opportunities so feel free to contact me for anything that involves data analysis or writing at ducajul@gmail.com, especially if it deals with social and environmental justice.*</p>
