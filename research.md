# Awards
In 2019, I received an award from IFRATH for my PhD on the topic of tangible maps and diagrams for visually impaired people.  
In 2015, I received an award from Google for my achievements as a young female computer scientist. 

# Research topics
At the [HICUP Lab](https://hicup.famnit.upr.si/), I studied how people interact and engage with interactive web documentaries, through data-based analyses of iOtok, a social issue webdoc describing the life of the last 13 inhabitants of the Croatian island of Bi≈°evo, threatened by mass tourism.

During my PhD, I studied how tangible interfaces could improve the accessibility of maps for visually impaired users. My thesis manuscript and a short summary is available [here]({% post_url 2017-11-03-Thesis %}).
