# Awards
In 2019, I received an award from IFRATH for my PhD on the topic of tangible maps and diagrams for visually impaired people.  
In 2015, I received an award from Google for my achievements as a young female computer scientist. 

# Research topics
At the HICUP Lab, I am studying how people interact and engage with interactive web documentaries, through data-based analyses of iOtok, a social issue webdoc describing the life of the last 13 inhabitants of the Croatian island of Bi≈°evo, threatened by mass tourism.

More generally, our research group investigates the potential of Augmented and Virtual Reality, for example to improve (environmental) education, reading, and experiences of new buildings.

During my PhD, I studied how tangible interfaces could improve the accessibility of maps for visually impaired users. My thesis manuscript and a short summary is available [here]({% post_url 2017-11-03-Thesis %}).
