## Awards & scholarships
In 2019, I received an award from IFRATH for my PhD on the topic of tangible maps and diagrams for visually impaired people.  
In 2014, I received an award from Google for my achievements as young female computer scientists.  
In 2012, I received a 3 years scholarship as the best student of my department.

## Education
I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toulouse. Before my thesis, I obtained  a Masters' degree in Human-Computer Interaction, and two undergraduate degrees: one in Modern Litterature and one in Applied Mathematics and Cognitive Science.

## Teaching
At the moment, I am teaching Human Computer Interaction and Data Visualizations for masters' students.  
In Toulouse, I taught some programming languages (Python, Java, Processing), Ergonomics and Human-Computer Interaction.  
I also taught French in 2012, at Clifton College, in Bristol, UK.

## Favorite tools
At work, my favorite tools are R (with ggplot), any text editor and Inkscape.  
I also use on a regular basis Processing and Illustrator.  
Whenever necessary, I like to try out new libraries/tools. Recently, I've been playing with D3.js, Jekyll (for this website), InDesign, BeautifulSoup (for web-scrapping) and Maperitive for customized maps.
